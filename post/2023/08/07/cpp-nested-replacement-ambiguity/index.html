<main>
<p>The <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n3096.pdf">C2X</a>
standard gives an example of a case where . . .</p>
<blockquote>
<p>. . . it is not clear whether a replacement is nested or not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Below is the example, in some detail, to expose the ambiguity.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="61044-rescanning-and-further-replacement"><strong>6.10.4.4 Rescanning and further replacement</strong></h3>
<p>The example source code is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">    #define f(a) a*g
    #define g(a) f(a)
    f(2)(9)
</code></pre>
<p>The tokens subjected to macro replacement are those that constitute the
invocation line <code>f(2)(9)</code>. The <code>active-macro-stack</code> is initially empty.</p>
<p>Once the scanner reads the first identifier <code>f</code> on the line, and searches the
list of defined macros for a match with that identifier, it finds a hit for a
function-like macro named <code>f</code>. On further scanning the line, it recognizes an
invocation, of the form <code>f(2)</code>, of that macro. The tokens forming the <code>rest</code> of
the line, <code>(9)</code>, are, at this point, external to the recognized
macro-invocation and to its replacement-list.</p>
<p>To prepare for processing the macro-invocation <code>f(2)</code>, the preprocessor (<code>CPP</code>)
pushes, on the <code>active-macro-stack</code>, an entry corresponding to the
macro-invocation. The name of the macro, <code>f</code>, is the most important property of
the entry.</p>
<p>The stack at this point is:</p>
<pre><code>    // active-macro-stack


    f(2)    &lt;---- bottom of the stack
    ---------------------------------
</code></pre>
<p>Now towards expanding the <code>f(2)</code> macro-invocation.</p>
<p>The full expansion (i.e. complete macro replacement) of the argument <code>2</code> is <code>2</code>
itself (the symbol <code>2</code> isn&rsquo;t subject to such replacement in the first
place, for it is not an identifier in the language of CPP).
After substituting the argument into the replacement-list of the macro
<code>f</code>, the situation is as shown below:</p>
<pre><code>    f(2)     rest
    +---     +---
    |        |
    v---     v---
    2*g      rest
</code></pre>
<p>The CPP now rescans the token-sequence <code>2*g</code>. The tokens for the symbols <code>2</code>
and <code>*</code> are not subject to replacement (they aren&rsquo;t <code>identifiers</code> in the
language of the CPP), hence they are output as they are, without any change.
The identifier <code>g</code> is part of the replacement-list of the macro <code>f</code> currently
being expanded, but it doesn&rsquo;t match with the name of any active macro
(i.e. with the name of any macro that is being represented on the
<code>active-macro-stack</code> at this point in time.)
Hence, this token for the identifier <code>g</code> is allowed replacement during
rescanning.</p>
<p>But <code>g</code> is the name of a function-like macro. Since the rescanning step has
access to the <code>rest</code> of the tokens, it can decide on the replacement of <code>g</code>
after looking ahead one token to see if it can possibly manage to construct a
complete macro-invocation.</p>
<p>In this example, the rescanning step can indeed manage to construct such an
invocation. The ambiguity arises exactly at this point.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="option-1"><strong>Option 1</strong></h3>
<p>One way to think about this situation is as described below:</p>
<pre><code>    f(2)     (9)  &lt;--- rest of the tokens
    +---     +--
    |        |
    v--      v--
    2*g  -&gt;  (9)



             g(9)
             +---
</code></pre>
<p>The token for the identifier <code>g</code> can be thought of as moving <strong>out</strong>
(marked in the above diagram with the arrow <nobr><code>-&gt;</code></nobr>) of the
influence of the active macro <code>f</code> whose replacement-list generated it,
because it needs tokens that are external to the replacement-list of which it
is a part. As a result, the entry for the macro-invocation <code>f(2)</code> can be
popped off the <code>active-macro-stack</code> and the entry for the macro-invocation
<code>g(9)</code> can be pushed.</p>
<pre><code>    // active-macro-stack

    f(2)    &lt;---- bottom of the stack
    ---------------------------------
</code></pre>
<pre><code>    // active-macro-stack

    (stack empty)
    ---------------------------------
</code></pre>
<pre><code>    // active-macro-stack

    g(9)    &lt;---- bottom of the stack
    ---------------------------------
</code></pre>
<p>The macro-invocation <code>f(2)</code> will no longer influence the macro
processing that lies ahead, including the immediate processing of the
macro-invocation <code>g(9)</code>, even though the token for the identifier <code>g</code> was
donated by the replacement-list of the very macro-invocation <code>f(2)</code> that was
popped off.</p>
<p>Now towards expanding the <code>g(9)</code> macro-invocation.</p>
<p>The full expansion of the argument <code>9</code> is <code>9</code> itself. After substituting the
argument into the replacement-list of the macro <code>g</code>, the situation is as
shown below:</p>
<pre><code>    g(9)        rest is empty
    +---
    |
    v---
    f(9)
</code></pre>
<p>The CPP now rescans the token-sequence <code>f(9)</code>. The identifier <code>f</code> is part of
the replacement-list of the macro <code>g</code> currently being expanded, but it doesn&rsquo;t
match with the name of any active macro. Hence, this token for the identifier
<code>f</code> is allowed replacement during rescanning.</p>
<p>It so happens that the substitution of the replacement-list of the macro <code>g</code>
results in a complete invocation of the macro <code>f</code>, without even
looking ahead into the <code>rest</code> of the tokens (Note that <code>rest</code> here is empty for
this example.)</p>
<p>Since the rescan determined that the identifier <code>f</code> is subject to replacement,
it pushes an entry corresponding to the macro-invocation <code>f(9)</code> onto the
<code>active-macro-stack</code>.</p>
<pre><code>    // active-macro-stack


    f(9)    &lt;---- top of the stack
    g(9)    &lt;---- bottom of the stack
    ---------------------------------
</code></pre>
<p>Now towards expanding the <code>f(9)</code> macro-invocation.</p>
<p>The full expansion of the argument <code>9</code> is <code>9</code> itself. After substituting the
argument into the replacement-list of the macro <code>f</code>, the situation is as
shown below:</p>
<pre><code>    g(9)        (rest is empty)
    +---
    |
    v---
    f(9)
    +---
    |
    v--
    9*g
</code></pre>
<p>The CPP now rescans the token-sequence <code>9*g</code>. The tokens for <code>9</code> and <code>*</code> are
not subject to replacement, hence they are output as they are, without
any change. The identifier <code>g</code> is part of the replacement-list of the macro
<code>f</code> currently being expanded (and also indirectly of the replacement-list of
the macro <code>g</code>. See the <code>active-macro-stack</code> above), and it does match with the
name of an active macro, <code>g</code>; an invocation of the form <code>g(9)</code> is currently
active as evident from the <code>active-macro-stack</code>. Hence, this token for the
identifier <code>g</code> is marked to prevent its replacement.</p>
<p>Even if there were further tokens in the source file (there aren&rsquo;t in this
example) that produced a complete macro-invocation of the macro <code>g</code>, that
invocation would not be considered for replacement because the token <code>g</code> is
already marked for non-replacement.</p>
<p>The output, then, is <code>2*9*g</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="option-2"><strong>Option 2</strong></h3>
<p>Another way to think about the same situation is as described below:</p>
<pre><code>    f(2)     (9)  &lt;--- rest of the tokens
    +---     +--
    |        |
    v---     v--
    2*g  &lt;-  (9)



    g(9)
    +---
</code></pre>
<p>The token-sequence <code>(9)</code> can be thought of as moving <strong>into</strong> (marked in the
above diagram with the arrow <nobr><code>&lt;-</code></nobr>) the influence of the
<code>active-macro-stack</code>, specifically of the active macro <code>f</code> with whose
replacement-list the sequence will be joined. This movement is required to
construct the macro-invocation <code>g(9)</code>. As a result, the entry for the
macro-invocation <code>f(2)</code> remains active, influencing this one macro-invocation
<code>g(9)</code>. But that entry does not influence any macro processing that may occur
on tokens lying after <code>(9)</code>. CPP pushes onto the <code>active-macro-stack</code> an entry
corresponding to the macro-invocation <code>g(9)</code>.</p>
<pre><code>    // active-macro-stack


    g(9)    &lt;---- top of the stack
    f(2)    &lt;---- bottom of the stack
    ---------------------------------
</code></pre>
<p>Now towards expanding the <code>g(9)</code> macro-invocation.</p>
<p>The full expansion of the argument <code>9</code> is <code>9</code> itself. After substituting the
argument into the replacement-list of the macro <code>g</code>, the situation is as
shown below:</p>
<pre><code>    f(2)     (9)  &lt;--- rest of the tokens
    +---     +--
    |        |
    v---     v--
    2*g  &lt;-  (9)



    g(9)       (rest is empty)
    +---
    |
    v---
    f(9)
</code></pre>
<p>The CPP now rescans the token-sequence <code>f(9)</code>. The identifier <code>f</code> is part of
the replacement-list of the macro <code>g</code> currently being expanded, and it does
match with the name of an active macro, <code>f</code>; an invocation of the form <code>f(2)</code>
is currently active as evident from the <code>active-macro-stack</code>. Hence, this token
for the identifier <code>f</code> is marked to prevent its replacement.</p>
<p>The output, then, is <code>2*f(9)</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>The direction of the movement between the tokens under the influence of the
top macro on the <code>active-macro-stack</code> and the tokens external to the
replacement-list of that macro determines the behavior that is exhibited by the
implementation.</p>
<p>Note that the tokens, external to the replacement-list of the macro, say <code>m0</code>,
that sits at the top of the <code>active-macro-stack</code>, can still be a part of the
replacement-list of a macro, say <code>m1</code>, that sits directly beneath <code>m0</code> on the
stack. Thus, such tokens are not considered external to <code>m1</code> after the
processing pops <code>m0</code> off the stack.</p>
<p>Subjecting the example to the latest <code>GCC</code>, <code>Clang/LLVM</code> and <code>MSVC</code> compilers
for <code>x86-64</code> shows that they behave as described in
<a href="#option-1">Option 1</a> - i.e., their behavior is consistent with that where the
tokens move <em>out</em> of the influence of the latest-expanded macro, instead of
that where the tokens external to the replacement-list are brought <em>into</em> the
influence.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Section 6.10.4.4</em> of the document declares these options/behaviors as
<code>unspecified behavior</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>behavior, that results from the use of an unspecified value, or other
behavior upon which this document provides two or more possibilities and
imposes no further requirements on which is chosen in any instance</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The section also warns:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Strictly conforming programs are not permitted to depend on such unspecified
behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Annex J, Section J.1, Item #24</em> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a fully expanded macro replacement list contains a function-like macro
name as its last preprocessing token and the next preprocessing token from
the source file is a (, and the fully expanded replacement of that macro ends
with the name of the first macro and the next preprocessing token from the
source file is again a (, whether that is considered a nested replacement
(6.10.4). . . . . . . . . .[is unspecified behavior.]</p>
